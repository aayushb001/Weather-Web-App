# Weather-Web-App
Weather Web App pulls data from forercast.io API and displays the data in a clean format.
Users are given the option to enter locations, which are converted to coordinates and sent to forecast.io.
The conversion is done through a google API.
The users can also enter a Epoch date to get weather for a specific date, in the future or the past. 
This was created using Angular JS, Javascript ,HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
